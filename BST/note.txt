binary search tree is same as the binary search

trees left part is always less then root and right part is always greater then root
(chek from root then nodes and append it)

inorder predeccssor and succer
    10 20 30 50 70 90 100

    30 nu inorder predeccssor = 20
    30 nu inorder succer = 50


BST's inorder is give always tree in the sorted form but we can't say for the (preorder, postorder)

Delet in BST : 
    left che to direct Delet    
    1 child to delete and connect
    2 or more child to -- (left subtree ema most right ne node sathe change kri dev) eighter (right subtree ma svthi left(smallest elemt) then swap with node and delete it)
