what is heap :
    is a complete binary tree that comes with a heap order property

CBT : every level is fully filled expect the last level
        node always added to the left

Two propertys:
    MAX heap : child is always small than node 
    MIN heap : child is always big than node 


node ith index  (heapify method mate incresion O(n) TC)
left child - 2*i index (1 base indexing) / 2*i+1 (0 base indexing)
right child - 2*i + 1 index (1 base indexing) / 2*i+2 (0 base indexing)
parent of child - i/2

CBT (n/2 + 1) to nth node is leaf node 

implemetataion : using array (1 base indexing)

insertion :  (nlogn method)
    step 1 insert at end
    step 2 take it to the correct place (parent sathe compare and then swapping)

deletion : 
    root :
        step 1 swap root node to last node a[1] = a[n]
        step 2 remove last node
        step 3 take root node to the correct possion



Heap sort : 
    step 1 swap arr[1] arr[n]
    step 2 last is sorted size--
    step 3 take root to the correct place (heapify algo)
