Dp : Those who can't remember the past are condemned to Repeat It.
DP was enhansed recursion subproblem are overlaping

1. -> choice hoi ema 
    -> recursive funtion 2 call kare to ema
2. -> optimal vastu puychi hoi (maxi, mini, largest)   -- also(greedy)
    -> count number of ways
    -> constraints that cause decisions to affect other decisions,

bottom up -> tabulation                        -- ek array creat krva no aave
    implemented with iteration and starts at the base cases

top down approch -> recursion + memorization   -- remembering part
    * implemented with recursion and made efficient with memoization
    * memoizing a result means to store the result of a function call, usually in a hashmap  
    an array, so that when the same function call is made again, we can simply return the 
    memoized result instead of recalculating the result.

DP is like divide and conqure but in (dp subproblem are overlapping)

1D dp - factorial, fibonaci, trigular number, (optimaization , combitorial problme, game theory)


(shortcut) : try to represent the problem in terms of idxs
            do all ppossible step on the idx accroding to problem statement
            sum of all stuffs -> count all ways min(of all stuffs) -> find min


memorization shortcut - look at the parameter changes
    step 1 : declare array size(n+1) dp[n+1]
        2 : before return add array dp
        3 : check if it previously computed or not if(dp[idx] != -1){ return dp[idx] }

tabulation shortcut - first declare dp array
            : first initialize base case dp[0] = 0
            : write a ittrative loop ( 1 to n-1 idex ) for every check pick or not pick
            : set dp[i] = max(pick, notpick)

some stratergies
    : pick and not-pick (coin change kind)
    : matrix chain multiplication
    : longest increasing subsequence (LIS)
    : dp on string / tree / bitmasking
