trees are hierarcy data struture

n = node/vertex
m = edges

for a generative tree / n ry tree  
    n nodes and m-1 edges

Trees: Hierarchical, no cycles, N-1 edges
Binary Trees: Each node has at most two children.
BST: A binary tree with ordered nodes.
Binary Indexed Tree:(Fenwick Tree) For efficient prefix sum queries.
Minimum Spanning Tree: A graph concept for minimizing edge weight.
Segment Tree: For efficient range queries and updates.

Structures that have 𝑁− 1 Trees, Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and Minimum Spanning Trees.
Structures that do not have N−1 edges: Binary Indexed Trees and Segment Trees.


to solve maximum question on it some steps:
    finding the one or more base base(recursion)
    calling the same function on left side
    calling the same function on right side
    join the result

    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        // base case
        if(root == nullptr) return 0;

        int left = maxDepth(root->left);
        int right = maxDepth(root->right);
        
        int ans = max(left,right) + 1; // height of the tree
        int ans = left+right+root->val; // tree nodes sum
        int ans = max({left, right, root->val}); // maximun in tree
        int ans = root->val == value or left or rifht // exist in tree(finding the value)
        reverse the tree

        return ans;
    }


BFS : level order travel
DFS : depth wise travel (inorder, preorder, postorder)
