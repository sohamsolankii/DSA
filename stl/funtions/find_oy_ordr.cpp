// find_by_order(k)  returns iterator to kth element starting from 0;
// order_of_key(k) returns count of elements strictly smaller than k;
// to find that all elements of vector are satisfy condition -->  all_of(v.begin(),v.end(),anything you want to compare with vector element)
// to find that if any elements of vector are satisfy condition -->  any_of(v.begin(),v.end(),anything you want to compare with vector element)
//same for none_of()
