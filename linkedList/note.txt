linear dsa -> made by collection of the nodes

one node store : (data,address) there for no inbuilt data type so need to creat to own

advantage : dynamic size 

disadvantage :  random access is not allow
                need more memory(need address and value)


doubley linkedlist : why we need the doubley lnked list

advatage : it can travles both direction (forward,backward)
            we can add node in for places (beginnig, end, after givern node, before given node)

disadvantage: they take more space
