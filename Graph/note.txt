node = vertex

undercted graph = biedirected edges

directed graph = directed edges

path in graph -> containg a lots of nodes and each of them are reachable
                a node can not appre twich in the path

undrected graph:

    degrees of node -> number of edges go inside and go outside total is degrees of the node
    total degrees of the graph is -> 2 * (number of the edges)

directed graph:

    indegree of node -> number of incoming edges 
    outdegree of node -> number of outgoing edges



inputs in  graph:
    n m                   -> n nodes and m edges and next m lines contain edges list

    stroing method of graph 
        edgency 1) matrix 2)list

    matrix)
        create matrix[n+1][n+1]

        if edges is (1 2) them matrix[1][2] = 1 and matrix[2][1] = 1


weitage graph:
    give the value of the edges / if not the standerd is 1
